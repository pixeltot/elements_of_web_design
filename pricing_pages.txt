Improving Your Pricing Page
---------------------------
- pricing pages should influence user decisions
- once people are interested and engaged, you need to present a clear,
  convincing argument that nudges them to take action
- offer content that answers a persons questions and informed choice
- show the cost, and everything you will get, in bullet form beneath it

Offer Recommendations
---------------------
people will be more compelled to do something when provided next steps or options.
- users value suggestions
  for example:
  - recommended option
  - most popular option
  - try it for free option

each option must also describe the benefits
- people want to know whats in it for them
- this can include rewards like money, rebates, or lifestyle benifits
- or helping users get published


Appealing To Intrinsic Motivations
----------------------------------
e.g. - with every product you purchase, we will help a person in need.


Reframe The Message
-------------------
- anchor people towards a specific choice, persuade them through scarcity, or
  user social motivators, such as social comparisons or social proof
- social proof = testimonials
- Donation recommendations are reinforced with behavioral science techniques,
  like social proof(how many people have pledged), and scarcity(limited time)
  -scarcity = limited time
  -social proof = # of backers


Pricing Pages Should Facilitate Action
---------------------------------------
after a person has made the decision to actm the next step is to help them follow through,
making the action as easy and barrier-free as possible
- simplify the action
- trigger action at the right moment
- guiding the experience


Guiding The Experience
-----------------------
- shape the experience in a way that facilitates action. common techniques include walkthroughs,
  callouts, or pre-determined defaults
- breaking up the setup process into small chunks makes it more approachable
  its more likely that users will complete the process


Trigger Actions At The Right Moment
-----------------------------------
- timing is critical, make sure you trigger a person to take action during the
  times they are most motivated and able to take action.

  for example:
  - users ned to create an account to write reviews, so when a new user is interested in contributing to the site
    and clicks on a "write a review" button, a modal pops up encouraging them to create an account
    the user is free to explore the site and read as much as they want, never try to make them sign up,
    only when they want to do something that requires an account will we ask for their information


Important Things To Keep In Mind
---------------------------------
- the paradox of choice
- progressive disclosure
This helps reduce the cognitive load on the user and help facilitate action

paradox of choice - the more options you offer someone, the harder it is to choose
                    this is called the paradox of choice.
                    - you are giving the user too many choices
                    - if they cant decide they will leave

progressive disclosure -  means you reduce page details to a minimum, and only
                          allow acces to basic information that enables the client
                          to quickly and easily achieve their objective.
                          - only show whats necessary
                          - if people are making a choice, limit the number of choices
                          - avoid the tendancy to over explain, or show everything at once
                          - most people will only consider the choices offered
                          - all choices should take users closer to their goals and yours
