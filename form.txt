Forms
-----
- make sure you put your labels above the input fields
  this makes it easier for users to see what they should write into the fields
- remove any uneccessary fields
  since the users need to be logged in asking for a first and last name would be overkill
  also remove any irrelevant fields


Using Optional Fields In Forms
------------------------------
- making required fields generally results in users skipping optional fields
- making fields optional is more likely to result in users filling out the form completely

Error handling should be clear and helpful, never blaming the user
try to understand the error and give contextual feeback


Explicit Choice
---------------
- research has shown that when a default choice is offered, most people do not deviate from it
  you can have checkboxes pre-checked for example


What To Consider When Creating Buttons
--------------------------------------
- why am i clickin this button?
- whats going to happen when i click this button?

make sure your buttons are large and easy to click
  - make enough padding inbetween the text and the edge of the button
  - make it look like a button
  - dont use default HTML links

try and avoid confusing or cutesy terms
  - links should be clear
  - users should understand what will happend when the link is clicked

what to consider when creating links
  - always use a hand cursor when creating a button/link
  - hand cursors signify the button is clickable


Confirmation Messaging
----------------------
confirmation messages can be extremely usefull, but its important not to over use them
- never user a confirmation message when you can easily give the user the option to undo
- its best to use a confirmation message when the user is doing something irreversible

  for example:
    - on Skype the user must confirm that they want to mute the conversation
      if the user didnt have the confirmation they may not know that the conversation was muted
      leaded to frustration
    - Apple uses confirmation messages when a user tries to delete older messages on their messaging app
      this is so a user doesnt accidentally delete a message they never intended to delete
    - any time you are charging a user you should create a confirmation message
      this will ensure they know that they are paying for something, and what they are paying for
      no one want to deal with accidental checkouts
