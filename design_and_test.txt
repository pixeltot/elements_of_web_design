What Is User-centered Design (UCD)?
-----------------------------------
User-centered design is a process in which the needs, want, and limitations
of a user are given extensive attention at each stage of the design process

having personas in place is the foundation of a user centered design approach


Building And Testing Each Feature
---------------------------------
there are five primary steps that you need to take:
1. identify primary feature to build based on personas
2. understand why the personas need this feature, or why this feature is important
3. research how other people have solved this problem
4. sketch and/or wireframe your ideas
5. test your design with users in your target audience


Primary feature of the the product comes first!
designing for mobile is an important part of any application these days
1. because people dont have a lot of time
2. because they can find things fast on the fly


sketching helps quickly get ideas out with less commitment
wireframes are a higher fidelity and are good for validating overall effectiveness of the design
here are some utilities for wireframing:
1. OmniGraffle
2. Sketch
3. Balsamiq


Put Good Copy In Your Wireframe
-------------------------------
1. Never use lorem ipsum when creating a wireframe
2. the client needs to know what they are looking at, and how to interact with it
3. when testing your designs, you need to know what to look for


The Five-second Usability Test
------------------------------
five-second tests help you understand a users first-impressions of your design
is your design easily understood and easy to use?
you're testing the feature, NOT the user
always remain neutral- you are there to listen and watch
never jump in and assist, dont lead the user
take good notes, capture what they do and what they say
try and test between five and seven users at a time


three simple questions:
-----------------------
1. what does this feature do?
2. what do you like about it?
3. what dont you like about it?

note: you should test on about 5-7 users at one time

Adding More Features And Tesing As You Go
------------------------------------------
Testing the entire process ensures that you are on the path in building a product your users actually want
understanding who your target audience is and tesing your designs are the core principles of a USD approach
