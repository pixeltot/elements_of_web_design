What Is Information Architecture?
---------------------------------
This is the process of organizing and lebeling the content making it easier for users to find
-structured
-organized
-labeled

examples of information architecture put to good use
1. trains stops - directions - icons
2. airports - primary information - icons
3. website architecture needs to help people find the content thay are looking for


The Four Primary Ways To Find Content On The Web
------------------------------------------------
1. known items - this is when you know what you want, and know where to find it
2. exploratory - know what you want, but are not sure where to find it - good labeling comes in handy here
3. unknown - dont know what you are looking for, not sure how to search for it
4. re-finding - looking for content you already have seen


Known Items
-----------
- If you know what you are looking for, and A-Z index navigation is useful
- Search bar is also a good tool if users know specifically what to look for
- quick links can be used to help users find what they are looking for as quick as possible


Exploratory
-----------
- navigation is important because its a good place to start if the user doesnt know what to look for
- search is a great tool becaues it helps users find what they are looking for
- related information will also help users find content they may be interested in


Unknown
-------
- simple language help users find things with basic non-technical labeling
- customer communication, or personal communication is a powerful tool with companies that offer complex services


Re-finding
----------
- looking for content you have already seen - e.g. recent shopping history


Start By Organizing Content Into Pages
---------------------------------------
- using posted notes helps you visualize the sites-structure
1. you need to identify your content
    -support
    -peer reviews
    -faq
    -my review reports
    -contact
    -bio
    -submit a review
    -social feed
    -homepage
    -articles
    -reviews
    -dashboard
    -direct messaging


You Can Group Pages Into Relatable Piles
----------------------------------------
for example:

1.  -contact
    -faqs
    -support

2.  -hompage

3.  -bio
    -articles
    -reviews

4.  -peer review
    -social feed
    -submit review
    -dashboard
    -direct messaging

-Have your users organize the cards in a way they understand it
-then have them organize the piles in order of significance
-fun the test with 5-8 users and look for correlating patterns
-with the results from the users the site layout will be self-explanatory

the most significant cards will end up being the persistant-navigation


You Can Now Start Building A Sitemap
-------------------------------------
sitemaps are like a floorplan for a website
gives a visual representation of the sites organization and how different section link together
once you have a site-map in plan, everyone working on the project can stay synced up

the hierachy of the site-map will tell you two things:
  1. what links will be in the primary and secondary navigation
  2. and where intersections paths will be necessary to make those paths accessible

-top-lvl pages
-organizing sub-content
-sub-sections

when reviewing a site-map make sure all
-sections
-sub-sections
-and pages
are represented


Help Users Understand Where They Are Within Your Site
------------------------------------------------------
- persistent navigation active state
- sidebar navigation active state
- these location markers should be easy for users to see


Content Associated With Articles
--------------------------------
 - persistent navigation
 - persistent side-bar navigation
 - content specific pages


Using Page Titles On Websites
-----------------------------
this is something you want to make a hibit of
displaying the page title for your webpage
you should always display a title for your web page
this should always match the name of the link to get to that page
the title should be just below the persistent navigation and above the actual content

this is a visual hierarchy


The Benifits Of Information Architecture
----------------------------------------
- helps you organize your pages and create good navigation
- helps users understand where they are and where to go
