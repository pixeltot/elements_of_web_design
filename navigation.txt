Common Conventions In Navigation
--------------------------------
1. logo that links back to the homepage
2. top level navigation - pages ['about','portfolio', 'contact']
3. optional top level utility navigation - login - sign up - sign out
4. always want to create a search function, which should be at the top of every page

its a good rule of thumb to only accomodate no more than 4 utility links in the persistent navigation


Descriptor Navigation
---------------------
- on home page a descriptor navigation, with conography and explanations
  this will give people comming to the site the ability to quickly find content that they find interesting

for example:
the smashing magazine site does this by seperating content into topics of interest
- coding
- design
- mobile
- graphics

spotify does this too, by organizing their content into genres
- mood
- party
- pop
- workout
- chill
- latino


Task-based Verb Navigation
--------------------------
- this is a good choice for the dashboard because there are a lot of actionable links here
- you frequently see verb based links on financial sites using words like:
  - invest
  - bank
  - trading


User-base Navigation
--------------------
- this helps users find content based on their needs
- with the ovelooktheatre you can have links like:
  - people that have reviews you like
  - reviews from people you follow that have not been commented on
  - peers - follow an overlooktheatre user whos reviews you really like
  - tags - create tags that you can link back to the things you reviewed the users page

- user based navigation is a common convention of pricing pages
  where pricing is divided out based on a users needs
  for example on the litmus site they use:
  - premium
  - plus
  - basic


Search Fields
-------------
Website users tend to be split between using navigation and search.
users who know exactly what they want tend to use the search field first
- smaller search fields will get one word searches
- larger search fields are more likely to get phrases


Google Pageview Percentages
---------------------------
according to Jakob Nielson:
  "viewing frequency drops off rapidly after the first page.
  more than half of all users dont scroll at all,
  so only 42% of users will see any information on the second screenful"

so its important to move the content the user is looking for to the first page

one way to do this is by sorting
  for example:
  - recent
  - popular
  - most commented
  - most reviews

  this will put the data in a new order


filtering is useful in a different way:
  - filtering reduces the amount of content being displayed
  - filtering removes irrelevant data


Tagging is also useful:
  when a user can tag their own content with relevant keywords,
  it makes it easier for them to search and find content based on specific keywords


Filtering examples:
  - color
  - brand
  - catagory


Pagination:
  pagingation is a universal option that allows users to access a big list of data
  google search uses pagination

Infinite Scrolling
  When dealing with large lists of user generated content infinite scrolling is the best option
  for example:
  - twitter
  - facebook

Tabs for Sorting:
  tabs clean up the page, and are easy for people to understand
