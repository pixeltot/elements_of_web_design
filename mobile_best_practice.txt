Web Pages Should Be Responsive
------------------------------
- a responsive web page can reshape to any device
  - desktop
  - mobile
  - tablet

  users should have a similar experience on a mobile and web app
  an experience on a mobile app should be consistent with the website
  this ensures that users will know how to user the product with little explanation

an important feature to keep in mind when deigning for mobile is:
- to keep things consistent with the web app

Continuous Content From Any Device
------------------------------------
although templates may change between device, content must remain seemless
for example:
  - when you read an article on the mobile app, it appears as recently read articles on the web app


Its Important To Understand The User's Goals (the users context)
------------------------------------------------------
think about context - make sure you design for the user's context, not the device
- who + what + when + where = context

for example:
  - you should read and be able to publish articles


Utilizing Hardware To Create A Better Experience
------------------------------------------------
- one thing you can do to improve the mobile experience is give users access to the devices hardware
  for example:  if they are working on an article, they should be able to take a picture
                with the device that they are using to create the article


Three Globally Recognized Logos
-------------------------------
- home icon
- search icon
- print icon

- its good to also include a text label when possible

a site can really benefit from having good icons:
 - icons make good targets, and are large enough to tough
 - icons should be at least 44px by 44px
 - icons are also great because they are fast to recognize at a glance
 - icons can be asthetically pleasant, enhancing your design

keep icon designs simple, and test them with your users
because icons are small, its good to keep it clear and simple

icons + labels = good designed icons


External Triggers Should Engage Users
-------------------------------------
for example:
  - social buttons on an article (tweet about what you've just read)


Using Internal Triggers To Engage Users Emotions
-------------------------------------------------
A cue that exists in the userâ€™s environment and provides information on what
to do next is called an external trigger.

for example:
  - say a friend of yours tweets they just read an awesome article
    since you trust your friends opinion, you're more likely to engage with that content


Successful Products Trigger Emotions
-------------------------------------
does your product make you feel:
  - happy
  - accomplished
  - uncertain? (google it)


Good Notifications Inspire Action
----------------------------------
- good triggers prompt action, while vague or irrelevant messages annoy users.
its important that there is a clear action to the trigger

for example:
  - when a user you follow posts a new article, we get a push notification
    from the app that we can tap to go read the article
this is a good, simple, personalized message with a clear action


Good Notifications Create Intrigue
----------------------------------
- intrigue can be created by notifying users of the most commented article of the week
  this will most likely tempt users to engage because they will want to know
  what everyone is talking about. it plays into out innate sense of curiosity


Make Signup As Simple And Easy As Possible
--------------------------------------------
- email login + get the link = logged in to app

  this will ensure that users dont have to remember a complicated password and
  have to enter it on their phones, they will get a link in their email and
  all they will have to do is click on the link to get access to the app


Help Users Onboard With A Short Tutorial
-----------------------------------------
launch a self-paced tutorial of the 'primary actions' a user needs to understand in
order to become familiar with the app
- make sure you are only showing the most important actions they will need to
  perform right away
- when using the tutorial approach, guide the user with a button
- each view should have one clear primary action the user needs to take
- guide them every step of the way
